# Spotify User Scripts

Created by Maciej Gierej - http://maciej.gierej.pl

## Spotify Skip
This script allows to temporarly skip songs in any playlist.

For example, you open up the new cool playlist you found. You like the song #1, but hate #2 and #5 or you just got tired of them. You can quickly mark them using a context menu and the script will automatically skip them when Spotify will try to play them.

It works in a shuffle mode as well.
